# CV builder

üìù Application to create Resumes with export in .pdf and .doc (coming soon...) files written in React.js and Typescript

## The idea behind
For months I was searching for a free tool which allows me to create, in an awesome way, my own resume without paying for it, but I failed.
I believe that this kind of tool should be free so I decided to start this project as a way to improve my own skills on React.js and the hope to have the necessary help from the open source community to create a great experience through the creation of our  resumes.
